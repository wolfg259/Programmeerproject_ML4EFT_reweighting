    "Having obtained a sample simulated .lhe event file, the proper observables first have to be constructed from the raw data, and the weights should be extracted alongside them. This is done with the pylhe library, as demonstrated in the code below that makes use (original taken from J. ter Hoeve, reworked). Here, the invariant mass $m_{tt}$ is extracted from simulated $t, \\bar{t}$-collisions, alongside the weights for two points in the parameter space of some Wilson coefficient."
